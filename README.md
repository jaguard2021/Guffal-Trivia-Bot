Bot.py 

Prefix: users can change the bot's prefix by changing command_prefix at the top of the bot.py file. 
For example, if they want to use ? as the prefix, they need to change it 
to bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix='?').

Make sure to replace 'YOUR_TOKEN' with a valid bot token in the bottom part of the bot.py code.

If the bot can't access the token correctly, please check the permissions and token for your Discord.
